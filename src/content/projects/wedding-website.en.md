## 🧩 Context

Organizing a wedding involves communicating a lot of information to guests: date, venue, accommodation, dress code, menus... Rather than sending dozens of messages, I decided to create a **dedicated website** that centralizes everything.

This project allowed me to explore **Next.js** and create a polished user experience for a personal and meaningful event.

## ⚙️ Features

- **Homepage** with countdown to the big day
- **RSVP system**: attendance confirmation with menu selection
- **Practical information**: ceremony location, reception, recommended accommodations
- **Photo gallery**: memories and couple photos
- **FAQ**: answers to frequently asked guest questions
- **Responsive design** adapted for mobile, tablet and desktop

---

## 🧠 Tech Stack

- **Next.js 14**: React framework with App Router
- **React**: interactive and reusable components
- **TypeScript**: strict typing for code reliability
- **Tailwind CSS**: modern and customizable design
- **Vercel**: deployment and hosting

---

## 🎨 Design

The site adopts a **clean and romantic** aesthetic:

- Soft and elegant color palette
- Carefully chosen typography (serif for headings, sans-serif for body)
- Subtle scroll animations
- Optimized images for fast loading

---

## 🔐 RSVP Management

The RSVP system allows guests to:

1. Confirm their attendance
2. Indicate the number of people
3. Choose their menu (dietary requirements, allergies)
4. Leave a message for the couple

Responses are stored and easily exportable for organization.

## 🚧 Status

The site is currently **under development** and will be opened to guests soon.
