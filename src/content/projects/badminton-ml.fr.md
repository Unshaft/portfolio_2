This project is part of **DataBad**, my personal initiative to analyze badminton matches in detail.

The goal is to automatically classify each shot (clear, smash, net, drop...) using video data and structured annotations. It combines:

- Pose estimation with **MediaPipe**
- Shot labeling and segmentation
- Frame-by-frame analysis with **OpenCV**
- Training datasets from personal matches
- Initial experiments with SVM and Random Forest

> The project is currently under development and will be progressively integrated into the DataBad ecosystem.
