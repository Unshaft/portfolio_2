    <p class="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      Hi, I’m <strong>Killian</strong> — passionate about <span class="text-gold font-semibold">data</span>, <span class="text-gold font-semibold">sports</span>, and <span class="text-gold font-semibold">creation</span>.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
      After studying Sports Science (STAPS) and completing a Bachelor's in Data Science, I pursued a Master's in Data Analysis, which I will finish by the end of 2025. I currently work at <strong>Median Technologies</strong>, where I’ve developed real-world projects involving medical imaging and machine learning.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
      My profile is hybrid: I work across data analysis, visualization, back-end development, machine learning, and even a bit of mobile dev and home automation.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
      On the personal side, I’m building <strong>DataBad</strong> — a complete app to analyze badminton matches, my lifelong sport, using data. I’m also working on an <strong>open-source portfolio</strong> focused on data, and I like to build tools that are useful, clean, and scalable.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-8">
      My goal? To work on high-impact projects where data serves people. I’m looking for a hybrid role where I can combine analysis, engineering, product development, and collaboration.
